## Overview

An end-to-end deep learning web application for tomato leaf disease classification using Convolutional Neural Networks.

The system allows users to upload tomato leaf images and receive instant disease predictions along with confidence scores and treatment advisory suggestions.

The project was trained on more than **7,500 tomato leaf images** across multiple disease categories using transfer learning and CNN-based architectures.

## Model Training

The deep learning model was trained on more than **7,500 tomato leaf images** using transfer learning and CNN architectures.

Training workflow included:

- Image preprocessing
- Data augmentation
- Feature extraction
- Multi-model experimentation
- Accuracy optimization
- Latency optimization

The final trained model was exported as `model.h5` and integrated with the Flask backend inference pipeline.

## Run Locally

### Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shoaib-ahmadd/AI-Tomato-Disease-Predictor.git
cd AI-Tomato-Disease-Predictor
```

### Setup Backend

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Backend runs at:

```bash
http://localhost:5000
```

### Setup Frontend

Open `frontend/index.html` using Live Server in VS Code.

For local testing, make sure `config.js` points to:

```bash
http://localhost:5000
```

---

## Deployment Note

The backend is deployed on Render free-tier infrastructure.

Due to TensorFlow model size and memory-intensive inference operations, the backend service may occasionally become unavailable on low-memory cloud environments.

For stable performance and accurate predictions, it is recommended to run the project locally on your system.

This project demonstrates practical experience with:

- Deep learning integration
- TensorFlow deployment
- Flask API development
- Frontend-backend communication
- CORS handling
- Model optimization
- Real-world deployment debugging

---

## Future Improvements

- TensorFlow Lite optimization
- Docker containerization
- GPU cloud inference
- Real-time camera prediction
- Mobile application integration
- Disease severity estimation
- Multi-crop disease support
